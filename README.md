# LJ_parsing
Instruments: PyCharm, Python, Selenium

Parsing of a full diary in livejournal.com for further publishing.
The task was to create a .txt file with all the posts from a LJ-diary, including the text under "lj-cut" and hidden posts (login data were known), also including the date and the title of the post.

There are also projects with parcing of telegram channels and hh.ru in the private repository.
